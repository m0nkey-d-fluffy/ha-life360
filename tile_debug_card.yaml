      ## 🔔 Tile BLE Diagnostic

      Below are all your Tiles with their derived MAC addresses.
      Press the ring button for each to test BLE connectivity.

      **Expected MAC Addresses:**
      - **Upstairs TV**: `EF:B8:09:80:8F:7F` (ID: `6fb809808f7f1309`)
      - **Wallet**: `C3:A7:57:B8:47:9C` (ID: `03a757b8479cbdfc`)
      - **Keys (Royal)**: `ED:87:F0:61:85:1B` (ID: `ed87f061851b0d6f`)
      - **Keys (Quaid)**: `ED:40:82:FE:9F:5E` (ID: `6d4082fe9f5e8451`)
      - **Cat**: `F4:24:9D:26:A9:FD` (ID: `74249d26a9fdabe9`)

      ✅ Working = Tile found via BLE and rang
      ⚠️ Failed = Fell back to API (Tile not in BLE range)
